# Applied Linear Statistical Models

### Python Notebooks

For convenience I have consolidated my new Python Jupyter notebooks for ALSM into my legacy R package. The aim is the same, to teach you how to do applied statistics through the ALSM text and coding practices that you can adopt in your professional life. I moved from data science to data engineering, and with that to Python from R. When a machine learning opportunity arose to investigate non-linear models, I was reminded that I do not know all the ways to do statistics in Python. I do not have an intuition when it comes to which packages to use or how to manipulate Pandas dataframes in the ways I did R or do with Spark, today. 

Therefore, enjoy these notebooks. Contribute if you have time. I do not plan to maintain this package, but it was a fun exercise I can always use for reference, which I still do with my legacy R package whenever I have to do R statistics, again. 


### Legacy R Package Nodes

This R package provides data and code for all of the tables and figures, to the extent I've completed them. Nearly all examples are provided, save for some advanced materials I wasn't prepared for some years ago when I coded this (e.g., neural networks). These will be updated in later versions of this package.  


Vignettes are complete, but the code base will require cleanup. Some package dependencies will be removed, such as rcmdr. Lattice plots may be converted to ggplot alternatives. Milestones will be set to track further inclusion of chapters beyond 18. Demos will be generated from the vignette's code script directly. This will maintain consistency between the two modes of presentation. Demos are there for the interested user; they're not the recommended mode of learning.
